        alarm_shelving:
          description: The alarm-shelving/shelf list is used to shelve (block/filter)
            alarms. The server will move any alarms corresponding to the shelving
            criteria from the alarms/alarm-list/alarm list to the alarms/shelved-alarms/shelved-alarm
            list. It will also stop sending notifications for the shelved alarms.
            The conditions in the shelf criteria are logically ANDed. When the shelving
            criteria is deleted or changed, the non-matching alarms MUST appear in
            the alarms/alarm-list/alarm list according to the real state. This means
            that the instrumentation MUST maintain states for the shelved alarms.
            Alarms that match the criteria shall have an operator-state 'shelved'.
            When the shelf configuration will remove an alarm from the shelf the server
            shall add an operator state 'unshelved'
