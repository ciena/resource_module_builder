          description: Maximum frame size that should be generated by the generator device. This H frame size should be set to leave enough room
            for extra encapsulation bytes that will be pushed onto the packet by the switch when pushing this test packet out on the network side
            port. A value of 0 indicates that the maximum frame size for the entity port should be used. The generator device will ensure that
            any frame size list or EMIX used during the test is adjusted accordingly. This field is only valid for a generator SAT entity.

        reflection_level:
          description: For reflector entities, this indicates the minimum reflection level required. If test traffic is going over an ethernet
            L2 cloud, l2-only is fine. But if the test traffic is going over an IP network, the reflector needs to be able to swap L2 and L3 fields.
            Depending on the type of IP network, the user needs to configure IPv4 or IPv6. L2 to L4 will swap MAC addresses, IP addresses and
            src and destination L4 port. Depending on the reflection level required, a different device is used to implement the reflector. This
            field is only valid for an 8.x reflector SAT entity. The default value is l2-to-l4.
