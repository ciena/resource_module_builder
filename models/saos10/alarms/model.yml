            alarm_shelving:
              description: The alarm-shelving/shelf list is used to shelve (block/filter) alarms. The server will move any alarms corresponding
                to the shelving criteria from the alarms/alarm-list/alarm list to the alarms/shelved-alarms/shelved-alarm list. It will also stop
                sending notifications for the shelved alarms. The conditions in the shelf criteria are logically ANDed. When the shelving criteria
                is deleted or changed, the non-matching alarms MUST appear in the alarms/alarm-list/alarm list according to the real state. This
                means that the instrumentation MUST maintain states for the shelved alarms. Alarms that match the criteria shall have an operator-state
                'shelved'. When the shelf configuration will remove an alarm from the shelf the server shall add an operator state 'unshelved'

                    will be shelved.
